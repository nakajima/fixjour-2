# fixjour 2 (to be renamed)

A rewrite I don't need to write.

The builder definitions are more like factory girl now.

## Usage

    require 'fixjour'
    
    Fixjour do
      define User do |user|
        user.name = "Pat"
      end
    end

The methods generated are the same old Fixjour methods:

    include Fixjour
    
    new_user(:name => "Pat")
    create_user(:name => "Pat")

That's it for now.
