# fixjour 2 (to be renamed)

A rewrite I don't need to write.

The builder definitions are more like factory girl now.

## Usage

    require 'fixjour'
    
    Fixjour do
      define User do |user|
        user.name = "Pat"
      end
      
      define Article do |article|
        article.user = new_user
        article.title = "This is a good one"
      end
    end

The methods generated are the same old Fixjour methods:

    include Fixjour
    
    new_user(:name => "Pat")
    create_user(:name => "Pat")

That's it for now.

## What's New

I ripped out a bunch of stuff. Here are some things I don't need:

### Overrides and `process`

The overrides hash in Fixjour was confusing to pretty much everybody I explained
it to, so it's gone now. PEACE.

### valid_*_attributes

This was useful for controller tests. Controller tests are no longer useful
though. I like acceptance tests now. Hopefully you do too.

### attr_protected attributes

They just work now. Don't worry about it.

### Fixjour.verify!

It's gone now. Write tests for your builders and you're good to go.

## TODO

* counters (or sequences in Factory girl parlance)
